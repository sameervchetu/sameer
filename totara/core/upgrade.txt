List of upgrade and API changes in Totara core


=== 2.7 ===

* \totara_core\event\user_firstlogin was removed, use standard \core\event\user_loggedin
  event instead, in case of first login $USER->firstaccess and $USER->currentlogin are equal.

* \totara_core\event\user_enrolment was removed, use standard \core\event\user_enrolment_created
  event instead

* MDL-48282 was backported. Do not update user->firstaccess from any auth plugin,
  the complete_user_login() does it automatically.
